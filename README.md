# Computational-Homology

This repository is for the code that I created while I was studying Persistence Theory for my undergraduate honors thesis. In this repository you will find the pdf copy of my honors thesis that dives deeper into the theory and a partial implimentation of computational homology. The code is not necessarily the most efficient, however, it provides a good foundation for anyone interesting playing around with a few toy examples.
