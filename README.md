# Computational-Homology

This repository is for the code that I created while I was studying Persistence Theory for my undergraduate honors thesis. In this repository you will find  a partial implimentation of computational homology. The code is not necessarily the most efficient, however, it provides a good foundation for anyone interesting playing around with a few toy examples. For more background on the theory consider reading my honors thesis at http://hdl.handle.net/1920/12810.
